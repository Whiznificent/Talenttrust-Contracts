//! TalentTrust escrow contract for milestone-based freelancer payments.
//!
//! The crate root exposes the Soroban contract and still owns several public
//! entrypoints directly: initialization, settlement-token binding, deposits,
//! milestone release/refund/cancel flows, reputation, work evidence, protocol
//! fee withdrawal, and dispute entrypoints. Supporting modules keep reusable
//! validation, storage, governance, and lifecycle helpers close to the paths
//! that use them.
//!
//! ## Escrow source tree map
//!
//! | Source | Responsibility | Storage keys owned or touched |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `lib.rs` | Contract wrapper plus root entrypoints for setup, custody, money movement, reads, reputation, work evidence, pause/emergency, fee withdrawal, and dispute orchestration. | `DataKey::Initialized`, `Admin`, `SettlementToken`, `Paused`, `Emergency`, `ReadinessChecklist`, `Contract(id)`, `(Contract(id), "milestones")`, `MilestoneApprovals`, `AccumulatedProtocolFees`, `ReputationIssued`, `PendingReputationCredits`, `Reputation`, `ReputationComment` |
//! | `amount_validation` | Stateless validation and checked arithmetic for stroop amounts and milestone totals. | None directly; callers write validated amounts to `Contract(id)` and milestone vectors. |
//! | `approvals` | Temporary milestone release approvals and release-authorization checks. | Temporary `DataKey::MilestoneApprovals(contract_id, milestone_index)`; reads `Contract(id)` and `(Contract(id), "milestones")`. |
//! | `deposit` | Deposit preflight and post-transfer accounting used by `deposit_funds`. | `DataKey::Contract(contract_id)` and `(DataKey::Contract(contract_id), "milestones")`. |
//! | `finalize` | Immutable finalization records, finalization guards, and final contract summaries. | `DataKey::Finalization(contract_id)`; reads `Contract(id)`, `(Contract(id), "milestones")`, `Paused`, and `Emergency`. |
//! | `migration` | Client migration proposals, acceptance checks, cancellation, and pending-migration reads. | Temporary `DataKey::PendingClientMigration(contract_id)`; reads and updates `DataKey::Contract(contract_id)`. |
//! | `ttl` | TTL constants plus helpers for temporary and persistent storage renewal. | Extends caller-provided keys, especially `Contract(id)`, `(Contract(id), "milestones")`, `NextContractId`, participant indexes, approvals, and migrations. |
//! | `types` | Shared Soroban types, error enums, summaries, governance records, dispute records, and the canonical `DataKey` enum. | Declares storage key schema only; does not access storage itself. |
//! | `utils` | Small deterministic helpers shared by entrypoints, currently ledger timestamp access. | None. |
//! | `create_contract` | Contract creation, participant/milestone validation, ID allocation, and creation events. | `DataKey::Contract(id)`, `(DataKey::Contract(id), "milestones")`, `NextContractId`, and `GovernedParameters`. |
//! | `dispute` | Pure dispute payout arithmetic and final-status selection for dispute resolution. | None directly; root dispute entrypoints update `DataKey::Contract(contract_id)`. |
//! | `governance` | Admin-controlled protocol fee, governed parameter, readiness, and admin-rotation entrypoints. | `DataKey::Admin`, `ProtocolFeeBps`, `PendingAdmin`, `GovernedParameters`, and `ReadinessChecklist`. |
//!
//! Generate this map with `cargo doc -p escrow --no-deps` and open
//! `target/doc/escrow/index.html`.
